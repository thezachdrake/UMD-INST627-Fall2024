Furthermore, we can see the number of games varies between teams which will affect their average.\n",

    "#Rising: When looking at the data year after year, it is easy to see that teams we've expected to do poorly have increased their stats. (Visual: dual axis chart showing improvement vs playoff attendance?) To uncover who's done the best, we've taken their average points per year and calculated whos shown the most improvement.\n",

    "#Climax: From our chart we can see the New York Knicks have increased their points at the highest rate. They're followed by The Sacramento Kings and Memphis Grizzlies. (Visual: line chart with top 5 teams?)\n",

    "#Falling: What this data is aiming to show is a teams ability to strategize and improve. By only considering teams who have historically been successful, we aren't seeing a full picture of the league.\n",

    "#Conclusion: When we join our stats together, we can see that our past questions revealed the Golden State Warriors do very well when in the finals and haven't had many consecutively bad seasons. This questions shows us they are also improving compared to their other high-ranking peers. However, to continue searching for a full picture, we hope to answer one final question."
