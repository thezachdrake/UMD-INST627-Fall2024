    "Intro: During the 2020-21 and 2021-22 NBA seasons, the league put COVID-19 restrictions in place to protect players and fans from infection while still allowing for some games to be played. These restrictions included playing the second half of the 2020-21 season in a bubble and playing the entirity of the 2021-22 season behind closed doors without fans. The league requested that our team conduct an analysis to determine the impact of those restrictions on the level of home court advantage, including whether any impact recovered following the lifting of those restrictions."

    "Rising Action: The first statistic we reviewed was the difference in win-loss ratio between home and away teams. In the 2019-20 season, the home team won 55.1% of games while the away team won 44.8%. While this does indicate a definite advantage towards the home team, the away team still has a decent chance of winning. This season was the last \"normal\" season before COVID, with the 2020-21 season cut short and resumed in a bubble and the 2021-22 season played without spectators in the team's usual arenas. While those restrictions would be assumed to have a significant impact on the win-loss ratio, our findings did not support that assumption."

    "Climax: In the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons, the home team win-loss ratio decreased slightly to 54.3% and 54.4% respectively. However, that decrease is not significant enough to support the assumption described above (note: need a hypothesis test to confirm). Similarly, while the away team win-loss ratio increased slightly to 45.6% in both seasons that decrease is not significant enough to indicate a shift in home court advantage (note: need a hypothesis test to confirm). Home teams still had a significant advantage over away teams, regardless of whether the game was played without fans or in a bubble."

    "Falling Action: While the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons did not include a significant change in the magnitude of home court advantage, the 2022-23 season may have. The home team win-loss ratio increased by 3.6 points to 58% (note: need a hypothesis test to confirm). This may be due to spectators returning to arenas following the lifting of most COVID restrictions. Alternatively, this may be due to away teams being less used to home fans."

    "Intro: During the 2020-21 and 2021-22 NBA seasons, the league put COVID-19 restrictions in place to protect players and fans from infection while still allowing for some games to be played. These restrictions included playing the second half of the 2020-21 season in a bubble and playing the entirity of the 2021-22 season behind closed doors without fans. The league requested that our team conduct an analysis to determine the impact of those restrictions on the level of home court advantage, including whether any impact recovered following the lifting of those restrictions."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Rising Action: The second statistic we reviewed was the difference in average points scored by the home and away teams in each season. In the 2019-20 season, home teams scored an average of 2.04 points more than away teams, with half of all home scores falling between 100 points and 120 points. While this does indicate a consistent home team advantage on average, it was not a significant advantage."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Climax: This advantage continued into the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons, although it was reduced in the former season from 2.04 points to 1.09 points. However, the advantage mostly recovered in the 2021-22 season, increasing to 1.96 points. This may be due to teams performing better once they exited the bubble and returned to their home arenas, however additional analysis is required to confirm."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Falling Action: As fans returned in the 2022-23 season, the average home team points advantage continued to increase and reached 2.61 points. This increase may be due to the return of home fans leading to an increase in home court advantage, however additional analysis will be required to determine the significance of this increase."

    "Conclusion: The COVID restrictions during the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons may have had a significant impact on the level of home court advantage as measured by the difference between home and away points. However, that element of home court advantage appears to have recovered in the 2022-23 season."

    "Intro: During the 2020-21 and 2021-22 NBA seasons, the league put COVID-19 restrictions in place to protect players and fans from infection while still allowing for some games to be played. These restrictions included playing the second half of the 2020-21 season in a bubble and playing the entirity of the 2021-22 season behind closed doors without fans. The league requested that our team conduct an analysis to determine the impact of those restrictions on the level of home court advantage, including whether any impact recovered following the lifting of those restrictions.

    "Rising Action: The third statistic we reviewed was the difference in average offensive and defensive rebounds scored by the home and away teams in each season. In the 2019-20 season, home teams scored an average of 0.38 more offensive rebounds and 0.95 defensive rebounds compared to away teams. While this does indicate a slight advantage towards home teams, it is less than a single rebound on average."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Climax: This slight difference between home and away teams became even more slight following the introduction of COVID restrictions. Home teams scored only 0.15 more offensive rebounds on average in the 2020-21 season, with the difference reducing further to 0.07 rebounds in the 2021-22 season. On the defensive rebound side, the difference was cut almost in half by the 2021-22 season, with home teams scoring 0.54 more rebounds that away teams in that season. This could be an indication of a reduction of the level of home court advantage, although additional analysis is required to confirm this finding."

    "Falling Action: While the differences in average offensive and defensive rebounds both decreased following the introduction of COVID restrictions, the lifting of those restrictions did not result in a uniform increase. The average difference between home and away offensive rebounds actually continued to decrease, reaching 0.066 rebounds in the 2022-23 season. On the other hand, the average difference in defense rebounds rebounded to just under its original mark with an average difference of 0.94 rebounds in the 2022-23 season. Additional analysis is required to determine the relationship between these changes and the level of home court advantage."

    "Conclusion: The COVID restrictions during the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons may have had an impact on home court advantage as measured by the difference in average offensive and defensive rebounds between home and away teams. However, additional analysis is required to fully determine the significance of this impact."

    "Intro: During the 2020-21 and 2021-22 NBA seasons, the league put COVID-19 restrictions in place to protect players and fans from infection while still allowing for some games to be played. These restrictions included playing the second half of the 2020-21 season in a bubble and playing the entirity of the 2021-22 season behind closed doors without fans. The league requested that our team conduct an analysis to determine the impact of those restrictions on the level of home court advantage, including whether any impact recovered following the lifting of those restrictions.

In the 2019-20 season, home teams successfully scored slightly more field goals on average compared to away teams (36.1% vs 35.4%), however that difference is less than a percentage point and may not be statistically significant."

While home teams continued to successfully score slightly more three-point field goals on average compared to away teams, they only scored 0.5 percentage points more in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons. The raw percentage of field goals scored by both home and away teams did decrease slightly in the 2021-22 season, however that decrease may not be significant."

Overall, the shift in the two percentages over the four seasons in our sample was less than two percentage points."

    "Intro: During the 2020-21 and 2021-22 NBA seasons, the league put COVID-19 restrictions in place to protect players and fans from infection while still allowing for some games to be played. These restrictions included playing the second half of the 2020-21 season in a bubble and playing the entirity of the 2021-22 season behind closed doors without fans. The league requested that our team conduct an analysis to determine the impact of those restrictions on the level of home court advantage, including whether any impact recovered following the lifting of those restrictions.

    "Rising Action: The final statistic we reviewed was the difference in the average succcessful field goal percentage by home and away teams. In the 2019-20 season, away teams actually made slightly more field goals on average compared to home teams (77.24% vs 77.18%). However, that difference is likely not statistically significant and does not appear to indicate any home court advantage."

The successful field goal percentages for home and away teams remained within half a percentage point in both the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons, with home teams having a slightly higher percentage in the former season and away teams having a slightly higher percentage in the latter. None of these differences appear to be significant."
