    "#Introduction\n",
    "#A \"good\" game isn't just about who wins. However, when it comes to which team to bet our money on, their points certainly matter. In evaluating teams for investment potential, scoring ability has traditionally been a key metric. With NBA scoring increasing in recent seasons, investors need to look deeper than just offensive output. Is a high-scoring offense truly indicative of a team's value and future success? To identify the most promising investment opportunities for the upcoming season, we analyzed scoring patterns from 2019-2023, examining not just point totals but offensive consistency. This comprehensive analysis aims to uncover teams that demonstrate sustainable excellence.\n",

    "#Rising Action\n",
    "#Initial market analysis might attract investors to the Milwaukee Bucks, who lead with an average of 116.44 points per game. However, high performance must be sustainable to ensure reliable returns. Our analysis shows that the top 10 teams all average over 113 points, indicating intense competition and multiple investment opportunities. The key question now is “Which team's offensive success is most sustainable?\"\n",
    "#(visualization) average points per game by team (top 10) & average = 113 points\n",
    "\n",
    "#Climax\n",
    "#The most meaningful insight came when we examined scoring consistency. While the Milwaukee Bucks led in scoring power, the Utah Jazz stood out in offensive efficiency, maintaining a high scoring average (114.12 points) with the league's lowest standard deviation (11.35). This remarkable consistency, coupled with their scoring volume, suggests an optimal balance of return and risk.\n",
    "#Additionally, teams like the New Orleans Pelicans, Phoenix Suns, and Denver Nuggets demonstrated exceptional consistency across over 400 games, despite not leading in raw scoring numbers. This highlights that offensive stability might be just as valuable as scoring power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Falling Action\n",
    "#This discovery showed us that being the best isn't just about scoring the most points. It's about being able to perform well game after game. While teams with higher scoring averages might attract immediate attention, the Utah Jazz's combination of strong scoring and consistency supports long-term value appreciation. \n",

    "#Premium Investment (Utah Jazz): Balance of high scoring and consistency, suggesting strong fundamentals and reliable returns\n",
    "#Value Opportunities (New Orleans Pelicans, Phoenix Suns, Denver Nuggets): Strong consistency metrics suggest possible market undervaluation\n",
    "#Growth Potential (Minnesota Timberwolves): Higher scoring but more variable The Utah Jazz’s combination of offensive excellence and consistency makes them a particularly attractive investment option."

    "#NBA scoring ability is often viewed as a key indicator of team success. However, it's not unheard of for a team to score poorly at the start of the playing year and still move on to the playoffs. Taking a look at consecutive underperformance can give us a better understanding of a team’s overall scoring ability. Analyzing game-point patterns across all season types—preseason, regular season, and playoffs—from 2019 to 2023, we investigated which teams have consecutively struggled to keep up with the league's scoring average.\n",

The Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers followed with 7-season streaks, suggesting potential value opportunities if these playing challenges can be addressed.

However, when we look for which teams had the least consecutive underperforming seasons, we can see that there are many teams that can turn it around within the 4 possible seasons types. This trend highlights a key market insight: a team's historical prestige or market size does not guarantee consistency in scoring capabilities, emphasizing that organization and player effectiveness is a critical factor in securing a game-win.\n",

    "#Introduction\n",
    "#In the NBA, playoff success is a crucial indicator of a team's value and investment potential. Making the playoffs not only validates a team's competitiveness but also drives revenue through ticket sales, merchandise, and media exposure. We analyzed playoff performance from 2019-2023 to identify which teams have demonstrated the most reliable postseason presence and how this might inform investment decisions.\n",
    "#(Visual: bar chart, by season type)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Rising action\n",
    "#Our analysis revealed interesting patterns in playoff participation. Five teams - the Brooklyn Nets, Denver Nuggets, Philadelphia 76ers, Milwaukee Bucks, and Boston Celtics - achieved a perfect record, making the playoffs in all five seasons. This consistent postseason presence suggests strong organizational stability and reliable performance.\n",
    "#However, playoff appearances alone don't tell the complete story. To truly understand a team's postseason success and potential investment value, we needed to examine how deep these teams went in the playoffs. This meant looking at the total number of playoff games played, which indicates both consistency and championship potential.\n",
    "#(Visual: bar chart - seasons in playoffs by team)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Climax\n",
    "#During 2019-2023, the Boston Celtics led all teams with 75 playoff games, followed by the Denver Nuggets (68 games) and Miami Heat (66 games). Both the Boston Celtics and Denver Nuggets maintained perfect playoff attendance while achieving high win rates (54.7% and 54.4% respectively), demonstrating consistent excellence. \n",
    "#The Golden State Warriors’ performance is particularly impressive, reaching 57 games in just 3 playoff appearances (19 average games per season) and the highest win percentage (63%), suggesting they went deep in every playoff they were present.  The Milwaukee Bucks round out the top performers with 65 games and the win percentage (60%) among frequent playoff teams. These metrics showcase why these teams stand out as the NBA's most reliable playoff performers, making them particularly attractive from both competitive and investment perspectives.\n",
    "#(Visual: bar chart, colored by season attendance and average games played)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Rising Action\n",
    "#On the opposite end of the spectrum, eight teams struggled with playoff consistency, making only one appearance in five years. These included established franchises like the Chicago Bulls (5 games) and Detroit Pistons (4 games). This stark contrast in performance highlights the significant gap between the league's most and least successful teams in terms of postseason achievement.\n",
    "#The data also reveals that historical prestige doesn't guarantee current success, even teams with rich playoff histories can face extended periods of postseason struggles.\n",

    "#Premier Investments (Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets): Highest playoff game count with perfect attendance, Consistent win rates above 54%, Most reliable returns through consistent playoff success\n",
    "#High-Efficiency Plays (Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat): Exceptional playoff performance when qualifying, League-leading win percentages (63% and 57.5%), Strong potential for deep playoff runs despite fewer appearances\n",
    "#Stable Value (Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers): Consistent playoff presence, Solid win percentages (60% and 52.9%), Demonstrated potential to advance in postseason\n",
    "#The Boston Celtics and Denver Nuggets stand out as the most attractive investment options, combining reliable playoff qualification with consistent deep runs. The Golden State Warriors' exceptional efficiency metrics suggest particularly strong returns during playoff years, though with slightly higher volatility due to fewer appearances."

    "#Introduction\n",
    "#In the NBA, defensive prowess is often the foundation for championship success. To uncover the impact of defense on team performance, we analyzed key defensive metrics-blocks and steals- from 2019 to 2023. Our goal was to identify teams that not only excel defensively but also maintain consistent winning records. While offensive statistics often dominate headlines, our analysis reveals the role defense plays in driving victories. These insights provide a data-driven perspective, aiding more informed decisions about team valuation and investment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Rising action\n",
    "#Our analysis uncovered compelling defensive patterns across NBA teams. The Memphis Grizzlies demonstrated exceptional defensive metrics, leading with 5.62 blocks and 8.65 steals per game, while the Toronto Raptors excelled specifically in steals with 8.91 per game. These metrics stand out historically, but they raise critical investment questions.\n",
    "#To truly understand the investment potential, we needed to look beyond raw defensive statistics. How well do these defensive metrics translate to actual team success? Are teams with elite defensive numbers consistently outperforming the market? By examining the correlation between defensive prowess and winning percentage, we aim to identify teams that combine defensive excellence with proven success - a potential indicator of sustainable long-term value.\n",
    "#(Visual: bar chart)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Climax\n",
    "#The data reveals a compelling investment story through defensive metrics and winning consistency. The Milwaukee Bucks emerge as the top performer with a league-leading 69.1% win rate while maintaining solid defensive numbers (5.0 blocks, 7.4 steals). Following closely, the Philadelphia 76ers demonstrate exceptional defensive capabilities with 5.3 blocks and 8.1 steals, translating to a 63.6% win rate. The Denver Nuggets and Boston Celtics round out the top tier, each converting strong defensive metrics into win rates above 62%.\n",
    "#Particularly noteworthy is that while teams like the Toronto Raptors show superior defensive statistics (ranking highest in total defense rating at 13.95), their lower win rate (56.8%) suggests challenges in converting defensive excellence into consistent victories.\n",
    "#This pattern indicates that for investment purposes, teams successfully balancing defensive capabilities with winning consistency, like the Bucks and 76ers, represent more stable investment opportunities.\n",
    "#Climax 2\n",
    "#Analysis reveals surprisingly weak correlations between defensive metrics and winning performance, with blocks (0.223), steals (0.061), and overall defense rating (0.167) showing minimal correlation with win rates. The scatter plots visualize this disconnect clearly - teams with high defensive ratings frequently fail to achieve corresponding win rates.\n",
    "#These findings challenge conventional wisdom about defensive metrics as team performance indicators. For instance, while the Toronto Raptors excel in defensive statistics, their lower win rate demonstrates that defensive prowess alone doesn't guarantee success. The scattered distribution across all metrics suggests investors need a more comprehensive evaluation framework beyond defensive capabilities to assess team potential.\n",
    "#(Visual: 2 scatter plots with trendline – one on avg blocks and steals, one on defensive rating)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Falling Action\n",
    "#The disconnect between defensive metrics and win rates has significant market implications. Valuation heavily weighing defensive statistics may be overvaluing certain teams while missing other investment opportunities. This misalignment creates potential market inefficiencies, particularly in teams like the Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers, who demonstrate success beyond pure defensive excellence. Moreover, teams focusing solely on defensive improvement might be misallocating resources, suggesting a need for a more balanced approach to team development and valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Resolution\n",
    "#Based on our analysis, we identify three distinct investment categories:\n",
    "#1. Premium Investments (Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers):\n",
    "# - Balance of defensive capability and winning consistency\n",
    " #- Proven ability to convert defensive skills into victories\n",
    " #- Most stable investment prospects\n",
    "#2. Value Opportunities (Denver Nuggets, Boston Celtics):\n",
    " #- Strong overall performance metrics\n",
    " #- Effective translation of defensive capabilities into wins\n",
    "#3. Cautionary Investments (Toronto Raptors, Memphis Grizzlies):\n",
    " #- Superior defensive statistics but lower win rates\n",
    " #- Need for additional performance factors beyond defense\n",
    " #- Higher risk profile despite strong defensive metrics\n",
    "#The Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers stand out as particularly attractive investments, demonstrating the crucial balance between defensive capabilities and consistent winning performance.\n",
