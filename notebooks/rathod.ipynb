    "#Question 1: How has the difference in win-loss ratio between home and away teams changed from the 2019-20 season to the 2022-23 season? (wl_home and wl_away columns in game table)\n",
    "##Introduction: \n",
    "###Home court advantage is a major deciding factor in the result of an NBA game. Since the pandemic prevented fans from actually attending the games in person, this question explores how this situation affected the win-loss ratios from the 2019 season to the 2022 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Rising Action: \n",
    "###First we extract the data on win-loss ratios for home and away teams for 2019-20 to 2022-23 seasons to compare the difference during the pandemic, then aggregate the win-loss ratios for the relevant seasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "##Climax: \n",
    "###By subtracting the win-loss ratios we see how the difference has changed between home and away games.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Falling Action:\n",
    "###The analysis shows a clear decline in the 2020-21 season win-loss ratio difference, which aligns with the pandemic when no fans were around for the games. This suggests that fan presence affects the home court advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Conclusion:\n",
    "###The reduced difference in win-loss ratios during the seasons we analysed shows that the pandemic had a significant impact on the results of the NBA games. "
